This is intended to be a collection of most of the well-known design patterns, with explanation, examples, illustrations, and everything you need to learn and understand design patterns.

## Introduction

`TODO: IN PROGRESS`

## Consuming the Content

`TODO: IN PROGRESS`

## Keep in Mind

* Design patterns can be easily **misused**, so make sure to fully understand the pattern, its use cases, and what is the problem it is trying to solve.
* Design patterns **doesn't have one way for implementation**, you can change the implementation, the components, and even mix between the patterns as you wish.
* Design patterns aren't the ultimate solution to a problem, they may even introduce a few problems of their own due to their limitations, so implement only what you need, and feel free to extend them with what you see fits your context.

## How to Use the Tests

You'll need this only if you want to play with the code and try new things, or if you want to contribute to the project.

```bash
# Installing the needed dependencies
$ npm install

# OPTIONAL: Run Compilation for Error Checking
$ npm run build

# OPTIONAL: Run Compilation on Watch Mode
$ npm run build:watch

# Running the tests
$ npm test

# Running the tests in watch mode
$ npm run test:watch
```
